These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Development Guidelines

- **Test-first development**: Write tests before implementing features or bug fixes.
- Run the full test suite with `python manage.py test` and ensure it passes before committing.
- Add tests for any new functionality or to prevent regressions.
- Keep commits focused and use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and include docstrings for new modules, classes, and functions.
- Use `rg` (ripgrep) for searching the codebase rather than `grep` or `ls -R`.
- Keep pull requests small and focused; include a summary of changes and testing results.
